// Coding Challenge #4

/* 
1. Re-create challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl' child class of the 'CarCl' class
2. Make the 'charge' property private;
3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery' methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl' class. They experiment with chining!

DATA CAR 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

GOOD LUCK 😀

// Coding Challenge #3

/* 
1. Use a constructor function to implement an Electric Car (called EV) as a CHILD "class" of Car. Besides a make and current speed, the EV also has the current battery charge in % ('charge' property);
2. Implement a 'chargeBattery' method which takes an argument 'chargeTo' and sets the battery charge to 'chargeTo';
3. Implement an 'accelerate' method that will increase the car's speed by 20, and decrease the charge by 1%. Then log a message like this: 'Tesla going at 140 km/h, with a charge of 22%';
4. Create an electric car object and experiment with calling 'accelerate', 'brake' and 'chargeBattery' (charge to 90%). Notice what happens when you 'accelerate'! HINT: Review the definiton of polymorphism 😉

DATA CAR 1: 'Tesla' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

GOOD LUCK 😀
